    "Scipy-Stats is basically a sub-package of SciPy library. SciPy library is a compelete package for performing statistical functions. Scipy-Stats is mainly used for  statistical operations and probabilistic distributions. in includes a wide range of probability functions.As the library is open-source, its statistical functionality is expanding.\n",

    "We have functions for both continuous and discrete variables and can work with different types of distributions like the binomial, uniform, and continuous. We can also perform the T-test and determine the T-score."

    "##### 1. rv_continuous:\n",
