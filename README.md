# Machine Learning and Statistics, Winter 21/22

## Introduction-to-Python-Libraries
This repositry provides some introductory examples to the most powerfull python Library called Scikit-Learn and an interesting subpackage of Scipy Library called Scipy-Stats.
It contains two Python notebooks named Scikit-Learn.ipynb and Scipi-stats explaining the most interesting and powerfull Python Libraries. 

Scikit-Learn.ipynb file gives a brief introduction to Machine Learning(ML) based python Library scikit-learn. It also contains implementation of three most interesting Algorithms of Machine Learning (i.e Decision Tree(DT), KNearest Neighbor(kNN) and Support Vector Machines(SVM) ). 
These ML algorithms are trained and tested on Scikit-learn's Provided Breast Cancer Dataset.

Scipy-stats.ipynb file provides a brief introduction to python Library scipy-stats that provides facility for performing Statistical and Mathematical Analysis on data. This file also contains implementation of an important statistical method ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE commonly known as ANOVA on dummy data.
